This update allows you to:

   -On the fly, during battle, change the Scale of the UI to you're liking.

   -Also fixed the problems people were having with the placement or UI components while playing with 
	different resolutions.

   -All of the Settings and improvements I've made are all configurable in the included Config file. 
	eg: Turn On/Off Frag's HD Mod, adjust Random Encounter Rate, Scale UI, etc...
F

Note that for certain setttings you must leave either go into battle, or leave a field(basically just 
go to another scene) for it to update.

Also remember to change the name of the CSharp file to whatever you need. 

There are only 2 of them now, Vanilla and  Trilititi's Alternate Fantasy. 
Both work with Frag's HD mod.

///Please do not change the formatting in the Config.txt file. It is hard coded, and may 
not work if you change anything buy the numbers///

Just modify the settings in the Config file to your preference.

:) 

Have fun!
